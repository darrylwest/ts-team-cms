That's an excellent architectural decision, and your thinking about "swapping out back and front ends with a minimum of complications" is spot on.

Here are my thoughts on this multi-repository structure for your "team-cms" project, with "cms-backend-service" and "cms-web-frontend" as independent sub-projects:

**Benefits of this Approach:**

1.  **Decoupling and Independence:** The most significant advantage is the clear separation of concerns. The frontend and backend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. A change in the UI doesn't necessarily require a backend redeployment, and vice-versa, as long as the API contract is maintained.
2.  **Technology Flexibility:** As you've already demonstrated by swapping out frameworks and databases, this structure makes it significantly easier to change or upgrade technologies for one part of the system without impacting the other. If you decide to move from Vue 3 to React (or vice-versa) in the future, or explore a different backend language, the impact is isolated.
3.  **Team Autonomy and Scalability:** Different teams or individuals can work on the frontend and backend simultaneously with minimal overlap or blocking. This is crucial for larger projects or growing teams, allowing for parallel development and faster iteration cycles.
4.  **Independent Deployment and Scaling:** Each service can be deployed and scaled independently. If your frontend experiences high traffic, you can scale it without touching the backend, and if a particular backend service (like content retrieval) becomes a bottleneck, you can scale just that component. This is very efficient for resource allocation.
5.  **Clear API Contracts:** This structure naturally enforces well-defined API contracts between the frontend and backend. Any changes to the API require explicit communication and versioning, which leads to more stable integrations.
6.  **Simpler CI/CD Pipelines (per repo):** While you have more pipelines, each pipeline is simpler and faster to run because it only focuses on one codebase.

**Considerations and Potential Challenges:**

1.  **Increased Overhead:** You'll have more repositories to manage, which means more separate CI/CD pipelines, dependency management, and release processes. This can sometimes feel like more administrative work compared to a single monorepo.
2.  **Cross-Repository Development:** When a feature requires changes in both the frontend and backend, developers need to manage two separate repositories, potentially two local development servers, and coordinate deployments.
3.  **Shared Logic/Types:** If there's any logic or type definitions (like the `BaseModel` or `Content` interfaces) that *could* theoretically be shared between frontend and backend (e.g., if you were to use TypeScript for both and wanted to share common interfaces), you'd need a strategy. In your current plan, the frontend consumes data via the API, so the backend's `models.ts` is its internal definition. However, if you ever wanted a shared types package, it would introduce another repository or a monorepo setup for just types. For now, relying on the API contract is sufficient.
4.  **Consistency:** Maintaining consistent coding standards, linting rules, and security practices across separate repositories requires discipline and potentially shared configuration files or templates.

**Conclusion:**

Given your stated goal of being able to "swap out back and front ends with a minimum of complications," this independent repository structure is an **excellent choice**. The benefits of decoupling, flexibility, and independent scaling far outweigh the minor overhead for a project of this nature. It sets you up for a highly adaptable and scalable CMS.
